## Abstract

In response to the digital revolution, it is necessary to establish a digital footprint for gyms in the health and fitness industry. This allows gym-goers to conveniently access information and manage their fitness plans. The project "PlanetFitness.com" is an end-to-end gym membership management application for the PlanetFitness chain, with locations globally. The objective of this project is to develop and implement an online gym membership system that will replace the traditional methods of gym registration and scheduling. The conventional approach has several drawbacks, such as delays in processing memberships, inability to cross-verify bookings, and lack of a digital platform to manage reward programs. These shortcomings will be addressed with the introduction of the online platform.

This web-based application is devised to manage all the fundamental information required to display the list of PlanetFitness locations worldwide, provide class schedules, services, amenities, and the reward program. This project aims to incorporate user-friendliness in various activities such as managing your gym rewards account, searching for gyms, booking classes, changing/canceling reservations, and more.

The primary goal of any web-based project is to establish an interactive user interface that is user-friendly, and we aim to achieve this goal in this project. This project principally utilizes the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and AWS services for an effective and efficient website. It encapsulates user-friendly design and functionality, allowing members to have a smooth and hassle-free gym membership management experience.

## XP Core Values Implemented

### Simplicity

In our software development project, we implemented the core value of simplicity by carefully evaluating every feature that needed to be added to the program. We made sure to choose the most straightforward yet effective tools and technologies to keep the program easy to use and accessible to everyone. By prioritizing simplicity, we were able to create a user-friendly and intuitive software that met the needs of our users.

### Courage

The core value of courage was essential to our software development project. As a team, we encouraged open and honest communication, which meant that every team member had the courage to speak up whenever they encountered problems or felt that something was not right with the team. By demonstrating courage, we were able to identify and address issues quickly and effectively, which led to improved team performance and a better end product.

### Respect

Respect was another core value that we prioritized in our software development project. We understood that working on a cooperative project requires mutual respect between team members, and so we made sure to listen to and consider everyone's opinions and ideas. We tried to put each team member's suggestions into practice while respecting their choices. When we encountered disagreements, we took the time to respectfully explain our reasoning and find a solution that worked for everyone. By upholding respect as a core value, we were able to create a positive and productive team environment that contributed to the success of the project.

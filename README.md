## XP Core Values Implemented

### Simplicity

In our software development project, we implemented the core value of simplicity by carefully evaluating every feature that needed to be added to the program. We made sure to choose the most straightforward yet effective tools and technologies to keep the program easy to use and accessible to everyone. By prioritizing simplicity, we were able to create a user-friendly and intuitive software that met the needs of our users.

### Courage

The core value of courage was essential to our software development project. As a team, we encouraged open and honest communication, which meant that every team member had the courage to speak up whenever they encountered problems or felt that something was not right with the team. By demonstrating courage, we were able to identify and address issues quickly and effectively, which led to improved team performance and a better end product.

### Respect

Respect was another core value that we prioritized in our software development project. We understood that working on a cooperative project requires mutual respect between team members, and so we made sure to listen to and consider everyone's opinions and ideas. We tried to put each team member's suggestions into practice while respecting their choices. When we encountered disagreements, we took the time to respectfully explain our reasoning and find a solution that worked for everyone. By upholding respect as a core value, we were able to create a positive and productive team environment that contributed to the success of the project.
